# Chapter 10: Light and material models

Videos of this chapter: see Moodle-Page

Further links:

* Demo for illustrating material parameters, also allows to compare two materials: [https://kjuen.github.io/MathDemos/MaterialComparison/MaterialComparison.html](https://kjuen.github.io/MathDemos/MaterialComparison/MaterialComparison.html):

* Interesting video series from Ted Haines: [https://news.developer.nvidia.com/ray-tracing-essentials-part-6-the-rendering-equation/](https://news.developer.nvidia.com/ray-tracing-essentials-part-6-the-rendering-equation/)
  (Video 6 explains the Rendering equation.)

Advanced reading (completely optional):

 * [Color: From Hexcodes to Eyeballs](http://jamie-wong.com/post/color/): A thorough
   discussion of color as electromagnetic radiation and its various computer representations.

 * [Physically-Based Shading Models in Film and Game Production](http://renderwonk.com/publications/s2010-shading-course/hoffman/s2010_physically_based_shading_hoffman_a_notes.pdf):
   Very readable lecture notes that cover the ideas around physically based rendering in
   more depth than we did in the lecture.
